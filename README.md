# Time Series with FB Prophet

In this challenge, I used data preparation, analysis and visualization techniques to gather insights into Google Trends for Mercado Libre ($MELI) and compare them to the stock's price and volatility trends. 

Later, I developed two time series model using Facebook Prophet.

1) A model to forecast future search trends of Mercado Libre.

2) A model to produce a daily sales forecast for the next quarter.

## Technologies

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.
